      <h2>Early Days</h2>
      <p>
        The first W4TRC repeater went on the air in the 19XX era, with a modest power budget and a
        simple antenna setup. Volunteers hauled equipment up the mountain and kept it running with spare
        parts and a lot of ingenuity.
      </p>

      <h2>Growth & Coverage</h2>
      <p>
        As membership grew, the club added additional sites to extend coverage. Coordinating frequencies,
        building cavities, and installing link radios became recurring projects supported by countless
        workdays and member donations.
      </p>

      <h2>Modern Upgrades</h2>
      <p>
        Today the system includes improvements like better filtering, internet links, and weather-hardened
        enclosures. Each upgrade builds on decades of hands-on knowledge from operators and engineers in
        the club.
      </p>

      <h2>Thanks to Our Volunteers</h2>
      <p>
        Every milestone in our repeater history was powered by volunteers: climbers, installers, RF
        techs, coordinators, and the people who keep the paperwork straight. Thank you for keeping W4TRC
        on the air.
