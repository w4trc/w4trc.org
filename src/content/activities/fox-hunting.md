## What is Fox Hunting?

**Fox Hunting** (also called *Radio Direction Finding*, or RDF) is a fun and challenging amateur radio activity where participants use radios and antennas to locate hidden transmitters — called “foxes.”  
These transmitters are hidden around the city or local parks, and each hunter uses signal direction and triangulation techniques to find their location.

During an event, a **primary fox frequency** is announced in advance. When the event begins, the fox becomes active, transmitting a repeating beacon signal every 30–45 seconds. Once you find one fox, it may lead you to others!

It’s a friendly competition that builds skills useful for **search and rescue, emergency communication, and antenna experimentation** — or just a great way to spend an afternoon outdoors.

## How a Typical W4TRC Fox Hunt Works
- 📻 **Frequencies Used:**  
  - 5 W Fox – 146.535 MHz  
  - 700 mW Fox – 146.595 MHz  
  - 15 mW Fox – 147.465 MHz  
  - 0.5 mW Fox – 147.585 MHz  
- 🕑 **Schedule:**  
  - Check-ins begin around **2:45 PM** on the **W4TRC 146.970 MHz repeater**  
  - The foxes activate at **3:00 PM** and transmit intermittently throughout the hunt  
- 📍 **Starting Point:**  
  - Hunters may begin **anywhere** they like.  
  - Many meet informally near **Big Lots (Fort Henry Drive, Kingsport)** before the start.  

The three transmitters are hidden together at the same location, each running at a different frequency and power level. They sound like short electronic beeps or tones, cycling on and off every 30–45 seconds.

During the hunt, participants are encouraged to **chat on the repeater** for camaraderie and coordination. Occasional hints may be given by the hiders.

Once you find the foxes, you’ll meet the hiders on-site — usually in a park or public space — where hunters often gather to compare notes and help others.

## Who Can Participate?
Anyone! You **don’t need a license** to participate — only to transmit. Since fox hunting is a receive-only activity, even non-licensed participants can join in by using a scanner or handheld receiver.

**Typical Equipment:**
- A 2-meter receive-capable radio (handheld HTs work great)  
- A **directional Yagi antenna** or similar directional antenna  
- An **attenuator** (optional, but useful for close-in work)

Even a basic omnidirectional antenna can work if signals are strong enough. If you’re new and don’t have equipment, contact the club — we can often pair you with someone experienced.

## Build Your Own Yagi Antenna
A popular DIY option is the **2-meter tape-measure Yagi** — inexpensive, portable, and easy to tune.
