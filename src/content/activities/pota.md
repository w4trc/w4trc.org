## What is POTA?
Parks on the Air (POTA) encourages portable operation from parks and public lands. Activators make contacts from within parks; hunters chase activators from anywhere.

## How we do it
- Watch the Events page and Discord for activation plans.
- Typical setup: 10–100 W radio, battery, wire or portable vertical, logging app.
- We log on paper or with N3FJP/ HAMRS and upload after the event.

## Get started
1. Create an account at **pota.app**.
2. Read the **Activator Guide** and identify a local park reference.
3. Join our next club activation and learn hands-on.
