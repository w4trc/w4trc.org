## What is SOTA?
**Summits on the Air (SOTA)** is a worldwide, points-based award program that promotes **portable amateur radio** from mountain summits. It’s designed for **everyone** — not just mountaineers.  
Operators earn awards as either **Activators** (who ascend and operate from a summit) or **Chasers** (who contact Activators from home, a local hilltop, or even another summit).

## W4TRC and SOTA
Members of the **Kingsport Amateur Radio Club (W4TRC)** regularly take radios into the Appalachian mountains for SOTA outings. These trips are great for learning portable skills, trying lightweight antennas, and enjoying the outdoors — and you do **not** have to be a club member to tag along.

We’ll post planned hikes and activations on our [Events page](/events/). Newcomers are welcome to observe, log, or make a few QSOs under guidance.

## How a SOTA Activation Works
- **Pick a qualified summit** – Only summits listed in the SOTA database count. (See links below.)  
- **Stay within the Activation Zone** – Operate within the summit’s **Activation Zone** (typically within **25 meters / ~82 ft** vertical of the true summit).  
- **Go truly portable** – Carry your station to the summit; operate away from vehicles and their power.  
- **Make contacts** – You need **at least 4 QSOs** (any band/mode, no terrestrial repeaters) for the activation to qualify for points.  
- **Log & submit** – Upload your log to SOTA to receive Activator/Chaser credit.

> Tip: Points vary by summit. Some regions have **seasonal “winter bonus”** points — details are in the SOTA rules for each association.

## Why Do SOTA?
- Practice **fieldcraft and emergency-style** operation  
- Experiment with **lightweight/QRP** rigs and antennas  
- Enjoy **spectacular views** while working regional and DX contacts  
- Encourage **fitness and outdoor safety** in radio

## Safety & Gear Checklist
- Route plan, weather check, leave-behind itinerary  
- Proper footwear, layered clothing, rain/wind shell  
- **Radio** (QRP is common), **battery**, coax, antenna (e.g., end-fed wire, vertical, or small beam), **mast**/throw line  
- **Logbook** (paper or app) and a way to **spot** yourself (cell, APRS, or a friend)  
- Water, snacks, sun protection, first aid, headlamp  
- Optional: CW paddle, mic headset, lightweight chair/groundsheet

## Chasing SOTA (From Home or Another Summit)
- Watch **live spots** and frequencies, then call the Activator with your callsign and signal report.  
- Keep contacts efficient; Activators may be on small batteries or in bad weather.  
- Chasers also earn points and awards — it’s a great way to participate without hiking.

## Join a W4TRC SOTA Outing
We typically choose approachable summits in the **Northeast Tennessee / Southwest Virginia** area with reasonable trails and parking. Check the [Events page](/events/) for dates, meet-ups, and recommended gear. If you’re new, we’ll help you get on the air safely.
