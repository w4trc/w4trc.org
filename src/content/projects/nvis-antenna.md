## Bill of Materials
- Wire for 40m/80m elements (e.g., 14–16 AWG stranded)
- Center insulator and feedline (RG-8X/58)
- End insulators, paracord/line, and stakes
- 1:1 current balun/choke at the feedpoint
- Mast or tripods to set a low (8–12 ft) height

## Instructions
1. Cut dipole legs for target band(s) and attach to a center insulator with a 1:1 current balun/choke.
2. Add strain relief and feedline; weatherproof connections with tape/heat shrink.
3. Deploy low (8–12 ft) with shallow angle legs for NVIS; experiment with height/angle for best coverage.
4. Trim ends to tune SWR in the field; note changes for future setups.
5. Document results (SWR, coverage reports) for future deployments.
