## Bill of Materials
- Mix-31 or Mix-43 toroids (sizes based on power/band goals)
- Enclosures (weather-resistant if outdoors) and mounting hardware
- Magnet wire or Teflon-insulated wire for windings
- SO-239/N/BNC connectors and strain relief grommets
- Heat shrink, silicone, and hardware for sealing

## Instructions
1. Choose toroid mix/size and winding recipe for your target bands and power.
2. Wind the core per design (bifilar for 1:1 current baluns, multi-turn for CM chokes).
3. Mount the core in an enclosure, wire connectors, and add strain relief/heat shrink.
4. Seal/weatherproof if needed; label power and frequency guidance.
5. Bench test: measure choking impedance or run on-air checks; log results for repeat builds.
