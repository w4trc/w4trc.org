## Bill of Materials
- 1" wide tape measure (for reflector, driven, directors)
- 1/2" or 3/4" PVC for boom/handle, tees, and elbows
- Machine screws/nylon lock nuts and washers for elements
- Short RG-58/174 pigtail with BNC/SO-239 as needed
- Hose clamps or zip ties, heat shrink, electrical tape
- Balun/choke (ferrite beads or a few turns near feedpoint)

## Instructions
1. Cut and deburr tape elements to your chosen design lengths (reflector, driven, director).
2. Mark spacing on the PVC boom and drill through-holes for each element position.
3. Bolt tape elements to the boom; keep them centered and square to avoid pattern skew.
4. Build the feedpoint: split the driven element, attach coax pigtail, and add a small choke or ferrite beads.
5. Add handle/tee pieces, strain relief for coax, and secure everything with clamps/tape.
6. Test SWR in the clear; trim driven element or tweak spacing a few millimeters to dial in resonance.
