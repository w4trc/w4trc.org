I was born in 1996 in Kingsport, Tennessee, and have lived in the area my entire life. I have been interested in computers for as long as I can remember, starting as early as elementary school. I’ve always enjoyed tinkering, taking things apart, and figuring out how systems work, which eventually led me into a career in information technology.

I didn’t discover amateur radio until 2020, when I came across a video on The Modern Rogue demonstrating Winlink by Josh Nass (KI6NAZ). [(https://youtu.be/YjJAWGGhG74)](https://youtu.be/YjJAWGGhG74) That video sparked my interest, especially because it combined radio with the digital and networking concepts I was already familiar with from a computer science background. From there, I began watching more of Josh’s content and diving deeper into learning about amateur radio, with a strong focus on the digital side of the hobby.

I earned my Technician license on May 24, 2021. I later upgraded to General, and on September 28, 2021, I received my current callsign, N4JHC. I later upgraded to Amateur Extra. While voice operation is enjoyable, I’ve always been particularly interested in how computers and radio intersect through digital modes and data-based communication.

I attended East Tennessee State University and graduated in 2018. Since then, I’ve worked in IT and currently work for a managed service provider as a field technician. My work covers a wide range of technologies, including networking, servers, and cloud hosting, which often overlaps with the technical skills I use in amateur radio.

Outside of work, I spend a lot of time homelabbing, running multiple servers and self-hosted applications from my home. I also enjoy web development and have put that interest to use by building and maintaining this website.

In amateur radio, I was really drawn into the HF world through Parks on the Air (POTA). Activating and hunting parks helped me gain confidence on HF and explore operating outside of a traditional shack. I was encouraged along the way by operators like Larry Dale (KD4FTN) and Justin Compton (KO4DCD), whose support helped push me further into HF operating.

Today, I continue to enjoy experimenting with digital modes and hands-on radio projects. My interests include APRS, SSTV, and Meshtastic, as well as exploring new ways to blend radio, networking, and computing. For me, amateur radio is a perfect mix of technical experimentation, learning, and community, and it continues to be a hobby where there’s always something new to explore.
