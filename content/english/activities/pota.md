## What is Parks on the Air?
Parks on the Air (POTA) is a program that was born out of the ARRL's National Parks on the Air Event in 2016. Since then it has spread to become an everyday occurrence. Points can be awarded for those who activate from a national or state park and those who hunt these activations also receive points and awards.

Members of the W4TRC radio club participate in POTA as both Activators and Hunters. The club will regularly go out as a group to activate different parks in the area. Anyone and everyone is welcome to join us as we activate different parks - you do not need to be a club member to participate! 

Activators must set up in a registered POTA location. (Visit pota.app for a list and map of locations) A successful activation consists at least 10 contacts. These contacts can be made on any band or mode of operation (except for terrestrial repeaters). 

To learn more, you can visit parksontheair.com, or reach out to the W4TRC POTA Coordinator, Justin Compton (KO4DCD).
